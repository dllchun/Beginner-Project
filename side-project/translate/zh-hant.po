"language: without filtering, if an entity has three translations it "
"will add three rows to the results; if you filter by language, at most "
"one result will appear (it could be zero if that particular entity "
"does not have a translation matching your language filter choice). If "
"a view uses relationships, each entity in the relationship needs to be "

"such as English or Spanish, or to the language selected by the page "
"the view is displayed on (the language that is selected for the page "
"by the language detection settings either for Content or User "
"interface)."
msgstr ""

"Because each result row contains a specific translation of each "

"that the entity title should contain a particular English word, you "
"will presumably filter out all rows containing Chinese translations, "
"since they will not contain the English word. If your view also has a "
"second filter specifying that the title should contain a particular "

"view row\" and \"Original language of content in view row\", which "
"means to display each entity in the result row using the language that "
"entity has or in which it was originally created. In theory, this "
"would give you the flexibility to filter to French translations, for "
"instance, and then display the results in Spanish. The more usual "
